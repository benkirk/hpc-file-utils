## Behaviour changes since the csg-utils import

- **Termination is race-free.** The Manager now treats a worker as idle only while it holds
  that worker's unanswered `ready`, receives each worker's messages in order, and polls every
  worker on every pass (see the docstring at the top of `manager.py`). Before, a walk could
  hang (a rank stuck in `MPI_Send`) or silently drop directories.
- **Errors end every rank.** A bad option or directory on rank 0 exits all ranks with rank 0's
  status (1 for a missing directory, 2 for a usage error) instead of hanging them. (Open MPI's
  mpiexec returns that status; Cray PALS's returns 143, as it SIGTERMs the remaining ranks
  once the first exits non-zero.) Any other
  uncaught exception, on any rank, calls `MPI_Abort`.
- **Errors are counted.** Directories that cannot be scanned are summed over all ranks. When
  there are any, the summary gets a `Scan Errors: N entries could not be scanned` line and
  stdout gets a final `--> N entries could not be scanned` line. `--fail-on-errors` makes the
  exit status 2 in that case (non-zero, 143, under PALS); the default stays 0.
- **Deterministic ordering.** Type, user and group lists break ties by name, so the summary no
  longer depends on which rank saw what first. (The size heaps already broke ties by path.)
- **`--max-dirs-per-send N`** [200]: subdirectories a worker collects before sending them to
  the Manager.
